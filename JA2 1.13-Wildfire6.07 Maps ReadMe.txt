This version contains the following Wildfire 6.07 content for the English Version of Jagged Alliance 2:

- WF maps

-----

IMPORTANT! Jagged Alliance 1.13 stable 4870 will not work with the WF6.07 maps because WF6.07 contains data which is not recognized by the old JA2.exe.

You will need to use the latest SCI (exe version 8309 or higher). 

-----

You can use the 7609 stable version, 
but you will need to rename the following files in Data-WildFire6.07\TableData\Map:

- FacilityTypes.xml.bak to FacilityTypes.xml
- SectorNames.xml.bak to SectorNames.xml
- SamSites.xml.bak to SamSites.xml

This will overwrite existing files. You may wanna make a backup-copy to preserve them for a later use with latest SCI (instead of 7609)

Installation:

1. Install original Jagged Alliance 2.
2. Download latest SCI and copy its content to JA2 game directory. Overwrite when asked.
3. Download WF 6.07 (Map Mod) from gitHub and copy its content to your JA2 game directory (except for the Data-WildFire6.06 folder which is not needed).
4. Modify Ini settings if you like.
5. Play the game.

-----

Compatibility:

If you want to use this map mod with "Arulco Folding Stock" mod or "1.13 Stock Data Overhaul" you will need to use the correct "Ja2Set.dat.xml".
I prepared example files "Ja2Set.dat.xml.AFS" and "Ja2Set.dat.xml.Overhaul" which you can use. Just rename the corresponding one to "Ja2Set.dat.xml".

-----

Desktop Background:

the folder "Extras" does contain alternative desktop backgrounds
