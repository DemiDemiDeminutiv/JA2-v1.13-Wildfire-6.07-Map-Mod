Alternative Desktop Backgrounds
*******************************

What's that?
------------

an assortment of files which can be used to replace the picture used for the desktop background in JA2-1.13 or mods of it

some are likely a thematic fit for JA2-1.13 and mods, others may rather file under weird or funny

check the Overview pictures to get a preview how it'll look ingame


Why?
----

many users reported to not like the picture used for desktop background in the WF-6.07 map mod 

and just to generaly offer more choice


How to use?
-----------

decide on one of the files named "desktop.pcx" in the respective subdirectories


put that file ("desktop.pcx") into Data-YourMod\Laptop and replaces the existing file of the same name


examples:

for unmodded 1.13:

Data-1.13\Laptop\desktop.pcx

or

for Wildfire 6.07 (Map Mod):

Data-WildFire6.07\Laptop\desktop.pcx
